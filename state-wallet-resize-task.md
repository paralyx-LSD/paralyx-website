# State File: Wallet Button Resizing Task

## Task Overview
The user requested to reduce the size of the wallet button ("cüzdan butonunu küçült biraz" - "make the wallet button a bit smaller").

## Context
This is part of an ongoing Paralyx website development project. The website features:
- React with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- MetaMask wallet integration
- Spline 3D background animation
- Custom AeonikTRIAL fonts
- Waitlist functionality with email collection

## Problem Solving Approach
1. Identified all wallet-related UI elements that needed resizing
2. Reduced button dimensions consistently across all wallet components
3. Adjusted text sizes and spacing to maintain visual hierarchy
4. Made complementary adjustments to email input field to keep consistency

## Changes Made

### 1. Wallet Connect Button
- **Old:** `w-[180px] h-[68px]` → **New:** `w-[140px] h-[48px]`
- **Position:** Adjusted from `top-[20px]` to `top-[30px]` for better alignment
- **Icon:** Reduced from `w-6 h-6` to `w-5 h-5`
- **Text:** Changed from `text-sm` to `text-xs`

### 2. Wallet Connected Area
- **Container:** `w-[180px]` → `w-[140px]`
- **Address Display:** `h-[68px]` → `h-[48px]`
- **Position:** Adjusted from `top-[20px]` to `top-[30px]`
- **Icon:** Reduced from `w-5 h-5` to `w-4 h-4`
- **Text:** Changed from `text-sm` to `text-xs`
- **Spacing:** Reduced gaps from `gap-2 mt-2` to `gap-1 mt-1`
- **Disconnect Button:** Reduced padding from `px-2 py-1` to `px-1 py-1`

### 3. Waitlist Button
- **Size:** `w-[320px] h-[60px]` → `w-[280px] h-[50px]`
- **Text:** Changed from `text-base` to `text-sm`

### 4. Email Input Field
- **Height:** `h-[50px]` → `h-[45px]`
- **Text:** Changed from `text-base` to `text-sm`

## Files Modified
1. `src/screens/Paralyx/Paralyx.tsx` - Main component with wallet UI elements

## Results
- All wallet-related buttons are now smaller but still maintain functionality
- UI elements are consistently sized across the interface
- Visual hierarchy is preserved with smaller text and spacing
- The overall design remains cohesive and professional

## Task Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - All wallet buttons have been successfully resized as requested by the user.
